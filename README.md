My customized CSS for a dark google calendar.
Adapted from [Google Calendar Redesigned (Dark Mode)](https://userstyles.org/styles/7339/google-calendar-redesigned-dark-mode)


I also use [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-morning-in-calendar/) extension to hide early morning hours, which I made dark and invisible in DarkTada.css

Tested in Firefox
